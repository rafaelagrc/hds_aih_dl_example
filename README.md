# Health Data Science - AI in Health
## Introduction to Deep Learning - Practical Example

This repository contains an AI/Deep Learning project focused on image classification using various techniques, optimizations, and best practices. The main goal of this project is to classify images into Benign and Malignant categories using different neural network architectures and strategies.

### Project Overview
In this project, we applied several key strategies to improve model performance, including:
- **Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (such as MobileNetV2) rather than training a model from scratch.
- **Balancing the Dataset**: Ensuring that the class distribution is balanced between the training, validation, and test datasets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applying various augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Optimization Strategies**: Choosing the right optimizer and hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
- **Regularization**: Using Dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
  
The project also includes various utilities for dataset preprocessing, performance evaluation, and visualization.
